## The Introduction 

On the 10th of December 2022, I had the opportunity to attend a Lecture at Chabot Space Center on [NASA's X59](https://www.nasa.gov/X59) project. The lecture was presented by a scientist from [NASA Ames](https://www.nasa.gov/ames).

## 10 Interesting Things

1. The nose of the X-59 aircraft is more than a third of it's length!

2. The X-59 airplane is going to do it's maiden test flight in the summer of 2023. I am so looking forward to this. 

3. The plane is designed to produce a much quieter type of sonic boom (around 75 decibels, similar to bouncing a basketball).

4. NASA is not doing this alone. Lockheed Martin is also helping with the craft.

5. Unlike most designs, this supersonic craft was tested in mostly computer simulations, not wind tunnels.

6. The whole project's goal is not to overshadow other attempts, but instead to demonstrate that supersonic flight is viable over land if the plane meets certain criteria. 

7. The airplane's predicted speed will be around 1,488.64 KPH (925 MPH).

8. Many other private companies are also working on their own versions of quiet yet supersonic aircraft.

9. The X-59 "mission" has the name of "Quesst"(short for Quiet SuperSonic Technology).

10. The X-59 will mainly be used to gather data about its sonic booms.
