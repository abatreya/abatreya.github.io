## The Poem

```
Look, do you see that tree?

The one with the nest way up top?

Must be interesting to be so tall

And live so long

That was what the old Redwood tree heard every day 

His magnificence of the present is incredible, for he
towers over the others

But the stories he can tell

Go all the way back to his birth of 2000 years ago

He remembers the first sensation of sunlight on his 
tender new leaves 

He remembers the tree-mother whose cone he came from

He remembers the young loving children who frolicked 
together in the undergrowth and cared for him

He remembers the stories his parent told him of his 
ancestors, who lived amongst giant creatures of majesty, 
who ate from their branches and nested on the forest floor

But, the Great Redwood does not feel happy. For what 
is the use of remembering, it is all gone now

His parent, consumed by a blazing fire

The children, long dead, killed by a plague

Those ancestors, just a long, passed legend

But, slightly muffled by twigs and other debris, he hears 
a young chirp

Then a second

Then a third

He sees the mother bird floating gracefully towards the nest

And the Great Redwood, for the first time since his early 
days, feels a happiness that is unmeasurable

The happiness, of creation
```

## Ending Comments

Just like the previous poem, this poem was made by me from an interest. Not of the cosmos though. This time, the trees take the center stage. Like the vast heavens, the trees tell a story. One that never stays the same, and changes depending on who tells it. 

> Standing in these forests is akin to standing in a cathedral, a temple, a canyon, or maybe even a mountain. The trees know far more than us, in many ways, and are one of nature's peacekeepers.
