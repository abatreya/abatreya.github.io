# Preface

Today, I went to the Chabot Space and Science Center to attend lectures on space.  I thought these lectures might be an interesting blog topic, so here you go!

This lecture on supernovae was told by [Dr. Jeffrey Silverman](https://jeffreymsilverman.com/). He first spoke of the death process of all stars, narrating each life cycle.  He talked about how Red Dwarfs shrink, how stars like our sun essentially just poof out into space, and how massive stars explode violently. Today, he said, we are going to talk about how massive stars die, in events called supernovae.  First of all, he split the lecture into two main parts.  One part was on type 1a supernovae, and the other part was on type 2 supernovae.  


Type 1a:  Death of a ghost
A type 1a supernova happens under a relatively common yet particular set of circumstances. First of all, there have to be two stars orbiting each other very closely.  Second, one of the stars has to be a white dwarf(a hyper-compressed star core formed after a sunlike star dies).  If these are filled out, then our time is set. The white dwarf, being much denser than its partner star, will pull off matter from its neighbor and start accumulating mass.  However, this has a tipping point.  At around one and a half solar masses, a limit called the Chandrasekhar limit is reached.  At this point, the white dwarf is so dense that it can’t hold itself together anymore, and explodes violently, releasing bright beams of light and energy.  All that is left is gas and maybe, the partner star.


Type 2: Self detonoation
A type 2 supernova is slightly different.  This type is called a core-collapse supernova, and for good reason.  Let’s take a particularly large star, about 8 solar masses, and set it on its life.  Throughout its days, the radiation produced from nuclear fusion holds back against the crushing weight of the star above.  However, once the core starts to run out of hydrogen, gravity temporarily wins and pushes on the core. This renewed pressure, however, allows the core to fuse heavier elements, and in the process, release much more energy.  Because of this, the star balloons to massive sizes.  Where it used to be maybe 5-10 times the sun’s radius, it is now hundreds or maybe even thousands of times larger.  The core continuously fuses heavier and heavier elements, until it reaches iron.  Unlike the previous elements, fusing iron takes energy away, causing the core to stop radiating, and giving gravity the win.  
The massive star, magnitudes larger than our sun, collapses in on itself, at 25 percent the speed of light.  All this mass bounces off the iron core and rebounds into space, creating an explosion that can be brighter than the galaxy it is in.  All that is left is ionized gas, that becomes a future home for new stars.
