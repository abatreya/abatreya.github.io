## How Are Stars Classified?

Stars are classified based on their visual traits, like colour, and phyisical traits, like size and mass. Star Classification is a way to classify stars, either based on their color and/or size and mass. Since stars have so much variety in between them, classifying stars allows astronomers to find a star with certain characteristics much easier.  Astronomers also classify stars in order to better understand the different types of stars in both our galaxy and our universe.

## Why is classification needed? 
Astronomers classify stars in order to make it easier to find a specific star amongst millions and to better understand how different stars behave. 

## Classification 

### Color based

One way of classifying stars is based on their color. 

1. M: Red Stars
2. K: Orange Stars
3. G: Yellow Stars
4. F: Yellowish-White Stars
5. A: White Stars
6. B: Blue-White Stars
7. O: Blue Stars

For example, our own Sun which is yellow in color is classified as a "G-Type" star.


### Size/Mass based

Another way of classifying stars is based on their size and/or mass. 

1. Dwarfs: "Smaller" stars that make up the magority of stars in the universe.  
2. Giants:  Larger stars that tend to be the aged phase of dwarf stars.  
3. Supergiants:  Even larger stars that are the aged phase of Giant stars. 
4. Hypergiants:  Extremely large stars that are the aged phase of O & B supergiants. 

### Blended Classifications 

In reality, both classifications are combined in order to ensure there are no overlaps. For example, in the constellation Orion, the red star Betelgeuse is classified as a "M-type Supergiant", and the blue-white star Rigel is a "B-type Supergiant". You can see both together in the picture below.

## Summary

Stars are classified in many ways, which can help if one star needs to be found out of a datapool of millions. Thank you for reading this blog! If you want to research further into these subjects, I would suggest [visiting](https://universe.nasa.gov/stars/types/).
