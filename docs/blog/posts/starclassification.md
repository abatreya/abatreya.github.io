## How Are Stars Classified?

Stars are classified based on their visual traits, like colour, and phisical traits, like size and mass. **Star Classification** is a way to classify stars, either based on their colour and/or size and mass.

## Why is classification needed? 
People classify stars in order to make it easier to find a specific star amongst millions.

## Classification 

### Color based
One way of classifying stars is based on their colour. The different classifications of stars based off their colour:

1. M: Red Stars
2. K: Orange Stars
3. G: Yellow Stars
4. F: Yellowish-White Stars
5. A: White Stars
6. B: Blue-White Stars
7. O: Blue Stars


### Size/Mass based

Another way of classifying stars is based on their size and/or mass. The different classifications of stars based off their size &/or mass:

1. Dwarfs: "Smaller" stars that make up the magority of stars in the universe.  Are almost always in main sequence.
2. Giants:  Larger stars that tend to be the aged phase of dwarf stars.  Are rarely main sequence.
3. Supergiants:  Even larger stars that are the aged phase of Giant stars.  Are only main sequence for O & B type stars.
4. Hypergiants:  Extremely large stars that are the aged phase of O & B supergiants.  They are basically just supergiants on overdrive.


Usually, these classifications are combined in order to ensure no overlaps.  For example, in the constellation Orion, the star Betelgeuse is a M-type Supergiant star, and the star Rigel is a B-type Supergiant.

## Summary

Stars are classified in many ways, which can help if one star needs to be found out of a datapool of millions.
