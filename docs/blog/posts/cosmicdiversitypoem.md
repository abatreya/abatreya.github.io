# Cosmic Diversity 

Today, I am going to do a slightly different type of blog. This time, it's part 1 of 2 on a series of poems! These poems are free verse, and I thought might be interesting to you.

## The Poem

``` bash
Down on Earth, we take things far away for granted

But these things, you see, aren't things that should be taken for granted.

Rather, they are creators,

Destroyers

And everything in between

Thus

Every time you look into the night sky,

You see a plethora of objects unmatched in their diversity.

Some, are lighthouses in the infinite dark

Others, are invisible forces of nature, unbeatable, yet idle.

And others yet, may contain lives not unlike our own.

Some, are so large and far that while we can see them, we will never reach them

Others, are as small as a pebble, and are only a long hikeâ€™s distance away.

Ever changing, flowing, on a scale so vast an unknown

Truly, an underrated masterpiece of creation and destruction.

This is, the cosmos.
```

## Ending Comments

This poem was made by me because it aligned with my love for space. This poem helps me picture the massiveness and majesty of the Cosmos, and I hope it does for you too.
