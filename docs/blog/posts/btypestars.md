## What are B-Type Stars? 

B-Type Stars are stars that are between **3 to 20** solar masses. They glow light blue and can live for around 100 million years. These stars are almost always main sequence, and can be very bright (up to 20,000 times the sun's luminosity).  Some famous B-Type stars are Regulus Aa in the constellation Leo, Rigel in the constellation Orion, and Algol A in the constellation Perseus.

## 3 Fun facts about B-Type Stars


1. Some B-Type stars are heavy enough to cause supernovae

2. B and O-Type main sequence stars are the only stars heavy enough to cause a supernova(They evolve into Red Supergiants or Hypergiants first though)

3. Despite being so large, B-Type Stars have low lifespans.  This is because the heavier a star gets, the faster it undergoes nuclear fusion.
