In this blog, I write about a few interesting details about the rovers that I think are worth highlighting. </p>","location":"2022/11/02/opportunity_and_spirit/#early-preview-to-good-night-oppy"},{"title":"10 Interesting Things","text":"<ol> <li> <p>The Spirit and Opportunity rovers were completely identical and effectively twins.</p> </li> <li> <p>The rovers were built in such a way that pictures taken from the cameras look as if a human was standing there on the surface.</p> </li> <li> <p>The two rovers, on their way to Mars, encountered a Solar Storm. This corrupted the software onboard and the Twin Rovers had to be rebooted.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spirit and Opportunity were only three weeks behind each other.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the landing procedure when the rover is just above the surface, the ropes would cut and enormous airbags around the rover would inflate, so that the rover could bounce along the surface and come to a full-stop safely.</p> </li> <li> <p>Both Rovers landed on opposite sides of Mars.</p> </li> <li> <p>Both Rovers were expected to survive for 90 days each, but both exceeded those expectations by a lot.  Spirit survived for 6 years, and Opportunity survived for 14 years.</p> </li> <li> <p>The reason why they were expected to survive for 90 days was because the Solar Panels the rovers used would eventually get covered by dust, effectively shutting down the Rovers.  Thankfully, dust devils on the surface of Mars would blow the dust off the solar panels, allowing the Rovers to still gather energy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each of the Rovers had an Autonomous failsafe mechanism, which would override human commands(People sent commands to the rover to drive).  For example, When Spirit touched a certain rock, the Autonomous failsafe mechanism kicked in and shut down the rover for a bit.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Opportunity rover was making great progress to a certain crater, when the team realized that the rover was, in fact, not moving at all and just digging itself into a hole while it thought it was moving toward its target.  They had to drive it in reverse to get it out.</p> </li> </ol>","location":"2022/11/02/opportunity_and_spirit/#10-interesting-things"},{"title":"Summary","text":"<p>I strongly recommend watching the movie.

He explained the different parts of the telescope, the launching and readying procedures. In this blog, I would like to highlight the 10 interesting things about the James Webb Telescope I learnt from this lecture. </p>","location":"2022/11/10/tenthingsjwst/#ten-interesting-things-about-jwst"},{"title":"10 Interesting Things","text":"<ol> <li> <p>JWST looks in the infrared spectrum, while Hubble looks at things in the visible spectrum. </p> </li> <li> <p>JWST looks in the infrared spectrum because, unlike visible light, infrared light is much harder to block, meaning there is more to see.</p> </li> <li> <p>JWST sits in a lagrange point (points of equilibrium for small-mass objects under the influence of two massive orbiting bodies.) Unlike JWST, most space telescopes are in an orbit around Earth.</p> </li> <li> <p>JWST has about 10 years worth of fuel for course corrections.  This was originally expected to be about 5 years, but the launch went so well that the operation time doubled.</p> </li> <li> <p>The rocket that would take JWST to space, the Ariane 5 (Built by the ESA) did not have enough space in its fairing to fit the whole telescope inside.  Thus, the telescope was built in such a way that it could be folded and put inside the rocket.</p> </li> <li> <p>JWST will be able to look back in time up to 13.6 billion years ago.  This is around the time when the Universe started to look the way it looks today.  Before then, it was all simply just plasma, with no empty spaces in between.</p> </li> <li> <p>JWST has 18 Beryllium mirrors with gold-plating on top. Beryllium was used as it is both strong and light, and gold is extremely reflective of both visible light and other forms of radiation, particularly in the infrared range.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Each mirror will align itself with the other mirrors to get a perfect image.</p> </li> <li> <p>The gold itself is not directly exposed to space. It's coated in a thin layer of amorphous silicon dioxide glass. This is because gold is soft and malleable. This makes it highly susceptible to damage from even a mild or tiny impact.</p> </li> <li> <p>To operate successfully, JWST has to cool down to 7 degrees Kevin.  That\u2019s - 447.07 degrees Farenheit!</p> </li> </ol>","location":"2022/11/10/tenthingsjwst/#10-interesting-things"},{"title":"Summary","text":"<p>Click here if you are interested in learning more about JWST. </p>","location":"2022/11/10/tenthingsjwst/#summary"}]}
